          <p>All analytics tools I know of track pageviews in a way that—to put it bluntly—simply doesn’t work for a growing number of websites today and is completely incompatible with the direction the web is heading.</p>

          <p>For the most part, these tools assume (by default) that each pageview corresponds to a full page load, and that each page load runs some analytics tracking code, and sends a pageview to a back-end server. Anything that deviates from this model requires extra work on the part of the site developer—work most developers don’t have the time or expertise to do.</p>

          <p>The reality is the web has changed a lot in the last 10-15 years, and more and more websites don’t fit this traditional model. Our analytics tools haven’t kept up.</p>

          <h2>The problem</h2>

          <p>To give you a specific example, consider mail.google.com (Gmail). Most people who use Gmail in their browser keep it open in a background and switch to it every once in a while to see if they have any new messages. When they do, they click on the message to read it.</p>

          <p>The vast majority of Gmail users almost never reload the page, which raises a few important questions from an analytics point of view:</p>

          
          <ul>
            <li>  If a user loads Gmail once, and then uses it hundreds of times over the next few days without reloading, should that really only be considered one pageview?</li>
            <li>If a user clicks the logo to refresh the content (or via pull to refresh in the mobile version of the app), should that be considered a pageview? Is that usage functionally different from refreshing the page to load new content?</li>
            <li>What about when the user loads a new message, should that be considered a new pageview?</li>
            <li>If two users visit Gmail the exact same number of times per day, but one of them loads the site anew every time and the other leaves it open in a background tab, should those two usage patterns result in dramatically different pageview counts?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The problem these questions are meant to illustrate is that, for some sites, sticking to the traditional definition of a pageview would result in very unrealistic usage data. And the problem gets worse when you a consider a single site that changes its implementation over time.</p>

          <p>Imagine you install analytics on a traditional content site. A few months later you update that site to be a single page application (SPA) without changing your analytics code. Then, a few months after that, you update your site to be a progressive web app (PWA) that reloads content in the background and works offline (again, without updating your analytics code). If the number of visitors you get to your site and the way they use it remains roughly the same, wouldn’t you expect your analytics data to remain the same as well?</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, in the above scenario your pageview counts would almost certainly go down as you make these changes, even though you’re improving the experience for your users.</p>

          <p>This is a pretty bad situation to be in: where you (the developer) want to improve the UX of the site, but you can’t convince anyone it’s worth doing since your analytics are telling a different story.</p>

          <h2>The solution</h2>

          <p>I think there is a solution, and the solution I propose takes a cue from the metric name itself: <em>Pageviews</em>.</p>

          <p>Instead of tracking how many times a page was loaded, track how many times it was viewed. We can do this with the Page Visibility API, which has actually been around for quite some time and is well supported in all browsers, both on desktop and mobile.</p>

          <p>As it turns out, tracking how often the page was viewed rather than how often it was loaded elegantly handles a surprising number of cases that fail using the current model:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>When users leave an app in a background tab and switch to it hours or days later without reloading.</li>
            <li>When users leave a tab open as a reference and switch to it often for quick access to the content (again, without reloading the page).</li>
            <li>When users open a page in a background tab and then forget about it (never actually viewing the content).</li>
          </ul>

            <p>The Page Visibility API consists of both the document.visibilityState property as well as the visibilitychange event. With these two pieces you can ensure that pageviews are never sent unless the page’s visibilityState is visible, and you can also send pageviews in cases where a user returns to your site after it’s been in a background tab for a while, by listening for visibilitychange events. The Page Visibility API solves the problem of how to track pageviews on apps that never need to be reloaded.</p>
        

          <p>The second part to the solution is the History API, which (now that it’s supported in all browsers) is the de facto way developers build SPAs. As a result, analytics tools can listen for changes to the URL and send pageviews whenever that happens. This allows SPAs to be tracked exactly the same way traditional sites are tracked.</p>

          <h2>Technical details</h2>

          <p>The basic idea for tracking pageviews with the Page Visibility and History APIs is as follows (and these steps can be applied to any website, regardless of whether it’s a traditional content site, SPA, or PWA):</p>

          <ol>
            <li> When the page loads, send a pageview if the visibility state is visible.</li>
            <li> If the visibility state is not visible wait for the visibility state to change to visible and send the pageview at that point.[1]</li>
            <li>If the visibility state changes from hidden to visible and enough time has passed since the previous interaction by this user, send a pageview.</li>
            <li>If the URL changes (just the pathname or search parts, not the hash part since that’s used for anchor links) send a pageview.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The third step above is the most important one, and it’s also the most ambiguous. The question is: <em> How long is “enough time” since the previous user interaction?</em></p>

          <p>On the one hand, you wouldn’t want to track every visibility state change as a new pageview since it’s common for users to frequently switch between tabs (and in fact some apps work best when used in multiple tabs at the same time and expect a lot of tab switching).</p>

          <p>On the other hand, you want to capture the fact that a user is returning to your site or application after not using it for a while (i.e. a separate usage instance rather than a single, continuous usage instance).</p>

          <p>Luckily, all analytics tools already define a way to differentiate between distinct usage instances, they’re called sessions.</p>

          <p>A session is a group of interactions that take place within a given time frame, and a session ends when some predetermined timeout period has passed. For example, by default, in Google Analytics, a session ends when there’s 30 minutes of inactivity. Most analytics tools give users a way to customize the session timeout amount if they want.</p>

          <p>So getting back to the third step in the list above, my proposal is that if a user’s session has timed out and the page’s visibility state changes from hidden to visible, a new pageview should be sent. Visibility state changes that occur in the middle of a session should not be considered distinct pageviews (though they can still be tracked as events if that information is relevant).</p>
